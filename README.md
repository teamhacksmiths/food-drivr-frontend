# Food Drivr Web App

## Getting Started

You'll need to install webpack-dev-server globally.

This one liner will do the trick for you
```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

### Installing
To install all of the projectâ€™s dependencies move inside the project folder then run
```
npm install
```
To run the webpack-dev-server to build and serve locally, run
```
npm run start
```
## Contributing

We would like to follow some simple guidelines to make sure every contribution matters and is current with the master branch. We are not extremely strict about any of these simple rules, but they can help improve the overall experience and make teamwork much more efficient!

### Commits

For the commits we follow the guidelines presented by [Udacity](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/). We are not strict about using capital letters or not so do as you please. Try to make commits that don't involve more than two different types from the guidelines.

### Branch

We prefer a branch focused on a specific goal (e.g. a refactoring, a new feature, a documentation update), rather than a branch that combines many multiple things. It will be easier to track down the issues and it will allow everyone to stay up to date with the master more easily.

**Always** update from master before making any pull request, resolve the conflicts on your branch to make sure the merging can go ahead smoothly.

If your contribution is small and doesn't add major changes to the project, you might consider committing to the master branch after consulting with the group leader (Frank). This will avoid pull requests with a few lines of code.

**Before** making any pull request or any commit to the master, make sure that no new errors have been added due to the change. Unfortunately we currently don't have a test suite so it might be tedious but essential to double check every feature.

### Pull Requests

If you make a pull request let someone else approve the request and merge. Before doing so it would be best for whoever is approving, to run the branch locally and make sure that the changes don't cause any new errors. Two pair of eyes are much better than one when debugging!

### Open Issues

Open a new issue if you find a bug in the project even if you are planning on solving it. This will allow everyone on the team to know about it in case they have not encountered it yet.

If you decide to work on an open issue, create a new branch and name properly so the team knows you are trying to fix it. This will avoid having multiple people trying to solve the same open issue.
